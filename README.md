# Data Mining in Yelp Data
## Overview
What problem I am trying to solve?

Yelp has become one of the most important sources of information for customers when it comes to choosing a restaurant to visit. Customers can read reviews from other people who have visited the restaurant before and see the overall rating of the restaurant. This information can help customers make an informed decision on where to eat and what to expect.

For restaurant owners, Yelp can be a double-edged sword. Positive reviews and high ratings can attract more customers and increase revenue. On the other hand, negative reviews and low ratings can harm the restaurant's reputation and lead to a decrease in customers and revenue. Therefore, it is crucial for restaurant owners to understand what makes a restaurant receive good or bad reviews on Yelp and take action accordingly.

To receive good reviews on Yelp, restaurants should focus on providing excellent customer service, serving high-quality food, maintaining a clean and comfortable environment, and responding to customer feedback promptly and professionally. These factors can help create a positive experience for customers and increase the likelihood of them leaving a positive review.

On the other hand, restaurants that receive negative reviews on Yelp may need to improve their customer service, food quality, and overall experience. It is also important for restaurant owners to respond to negative reviews promptly and professionally, addressing the customer's concerns and taking steps to prevent similar issues from happening in the future.

In conclusion, Yelp has become a critical tool for customers and restaurant owners alike. By understanding what makes a restaurant receive good or bad reviews on Yelp, restaurant owners can improve their business and provide a better experience for their customers, ultimately leading to increased revenue and success.
